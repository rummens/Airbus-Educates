# Workshop Dashboard Reference

This document describes the layout and behavior of the Educates workshop dashboard, with guidance for writing workshop instructions that account for the single-tab visibility constraint.

## Dashboard Layout

The workshop dashboard is divided into two main areas:

- **Left panel (~30% width)**: Workshop instructions. Users read through the instructions and interact with clickable actions here.
- **Right panel (~70% width)**: Dashboard tabs. This area displays one tab at a time from a set of available tabs such as Terminal, Editor, Console, and any custom dashboard tabs.

Only one dashboard tab is visible at a time. To see a different tab, the user must click on the tab header or use a `dashboard:open-dashboard` clickable action in the workshop instructions.

## Default Tab on Startup

The Terminal tab is shown by default when a workshop session starts. This is configurable through the workshop definition, but most workshops use this default.

## Switching Between Tabs

Users can switch the visible dashboard tab in two ways:

1. **Manually** — clicking on the tab header in the dashboard area.
2. **Via clickable action** — using `dashboard:open-dashboard` in the workshop instructions to programmatically switch to a named tab.

Example clickable action to switch to the Editor tab:

````markdown
```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Editor
```
````

### Implicit Tab Exposure by Terminal and Editor Actions

All terminal clickable actions (`terminal:execute`, `terminal:input`, `terminal:interrupt`, `terminal:select`, `terminal:clear`, etc.) automatically expose the Terminal dashboard tab when triggered. Similarly, all editor clickable actions (`editor:open-file`, `editor:create-file`, `editor:replace-matching-text`, `editor:append-lines-to-file`, `editor:prepend-lines-to-file`, etc.) automatically expose the Editor dashboard tab.

Because these actions already make the relevant tab visible, do not add a `dashboard:open-dashboard` action immediately after them to open the Terminal or Editor tab — it is redundant.

**Avoid this — redundant tab switch after an editor action:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: "nginx:1.19"
replacement: "nginx:1.25"
```

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Editor
```
````

The `dashboard:open-dashboard` above is unnecessary because `editor:replace-matching-text` already exposed the Editor tab.

**Correct — the editor action alone is sufficient:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: "nginx:1.19"
replacement: "nginx:1.25"
```
````

The same applies to terminal actions. For example, `terminal:execute` already exposes the Terminal tab, so following it with `dashboard:open-dashboard` for Terminal is redundant.

Note that `dashboard:open-dashboard` is still needed when switching to other dashboard tabs such as custom web application tabs, Console, or any tab that is not the direct target of a terminal or editor action. The guidance in the next section on managing tab visibility for custom tabs remains important.

## Dashboard Tabs Have No URL Bar

Dashboard tabs display embedded content inside an iframe. Unlike a regular browser window, the iframe has no URL bar — the user cannot see or change the URL that the dashboard tab is pointing at. Similarly, because the content is embedded in an iframe, the page title set by the embedded web application is not visible anywhere in the browser — the browser tab/window title is controlled by the topmost parent page (the Educates dashboard itself), so any `<title>` element in the embedded page is hidden from the user.

This means that if a workshop needs to change what URL a dashboard tab displays (for example, navigating from the top-level page of a web application to a sub-path), the workshop instructions must do so explicitly using the `dashboard:reload-dashboard` clickable action with a new `url` property. The user has no way to do this themselves.

This applies equally to dashboard tabs created via `spec.session.dashboards` in the workshop definition, via `dashboard:create-dashboard` in the workshop instructions, or via `dashboard:reload-dashboard` itself (which creates the tab if it does not already exist).

## Single-Tab Visibility and Its Implications

Because only one dashboard tab can be seen at a time, workshop authors must be mindful of which tab is visible at each point in the instructions. This is especially important when the workshop uses a custom dashboard tab to display a web application (e.g., accessed through the session proxy).

### The Tab Switching Problem

Consider a workshop where a dashboard tab named "Application" shows a web application. If the instructions then ask the user to run a terminal command (either explicitly via `terminal:execute` or by telling them to type in the terminal), the Terminal tab becomes visible and the Application tab is hidden. The user cannot see the effect of the command on the web application until they switch back to the Application tab.

If the workshop instructions do not account for this, users will be confused — they ran the command but cannot see the result.

### Writing Instructions That Account for Tab Visibility

When workshop instructions involve switching between viewing a web application (or any non-terminal dashboard tab) and running terminal commands, you must explicitly guide the user back to the correct tab to see the result. Follow these patterns:

**Pattern 1: Run command, then switch back to view result**

After a terminal command that affects a web application displayed in a dashboard tab, include a clickable action or instruction to return to that tab:

````markdown
Run the following command to restart the application:

```terminal:execute
command: ./restart-app.sh
```

Once the application has restarted, switch back to the Application tab to see the changes:

```dashboard:open-dashboard
name: Application
```
````

**Pattern 2: Reload the dashboard tab after a command**

If the web application needs to be refreshed to show the result (or the URL needs to change), use `dashboard:reload-dashboard` which both reloads the content and switches focus to the tab. Use this instead of Pattern 1 only when the content genuinely needs reloading — if you just need to make the tab visible, `dashboard:open-dashboard` is sufficient and avoids an unnecessary iframe reload:

````markdown
Apply the configuration change:

```terminal:execute
command: ./apply-config.sh
```

Reload the application to see the updated configuration:

```dashboard:reload-dashboard
name: Application
```
````

**Pattern 3: Remind users to switch tabs manually**

When a clickable action is not appropriate (e.g., the user needs to wait for something to complete first), include clear prose telling the user which tab to switch to:

```markdown
After the deployment finishes, click on the **Application** tab in the
dashboard to see the running application.
```

### General Guidelines

- **Track which tab is visible** at each point in the instructions, just as you track the terminal working directory. Every `terminal:execute` action makes the Terminal tab visible. Every `dashboard:open-dashboard` or `dashboard:reload-dashboard` action switches to the named tab.
- **Always guide the user back** to the relevant tab after running a command that changes the visible tab. Do not assume the user will know to switch tabs on their own.
- **Place the tab switch immediately after** the action that requires it. Do not leave multiple steps between running a command and telling the user to look at another tab — they may become confused about what they should be seeing.
- **Use `dashboard:open-dashboard` to make a tab visible** when you do not need to reload its content. Do not use `dashboard:reload-dashboard` without a `url` just to switch to a tab — this triggers an unnecessary iframe reload. Reserve `dashboard:reload-dashboard` for cases where the content needs refreshing or the URL needs to change.
- **Consider combining steps** when a command is run only for its side effect on a web application. It may be clearer to run the command and immediately switch to the application tab in quick succession, rather than having the user linger on the terminal output.

## Choosing Between Pre-defined and Dynamically Created Dashboard Tabs

Dashboard tabs for web applications can be created in two ways:

1. **Pre-defined** — declared in `spec.session.dashboards` in the workshop definition. The tab exists from the start of the session.
2. **Dynamically created** — added from the workshop instructions using the `dashboard:create-dashboard` clickable action at the point the tab is first needed.

When a workshop will use `dashboard:reload-dashboard` to change a dashboard tab's URL during the instructions (for example, navigating from the top-level page of a web application to a sub-path), prefer creating the tab dynamically with `dashboard:create-dashboard` rather than pre-defining it in `spec.session.dashboards`.

The reason is readability: if the dashboard is pre-defined in the workshop definition, the initial URL is hidden away in the YAML configuration. When `dashboard:reload-dashboard` later appears in the instructions with a specific URL, the reader has no context for what URL was there before or why it is being changed. By creating the tab dynamically, the initial URL is visible in the instructions right where the reader first encounters the tab, making the later URL change easy to understand.

**Avoid this — pre-defined dashboard with a later URL change that lacks context:**

The workshop definition contains:

```yaml
# Path: spec.session
session:
  dashboards:
  - name: Application
    url: "$(ingress_protocol)://app-$(session_hostname)/"
```

Then later in the workshop instructions, a `dashboard:reload-dashboard` appears with a new URL but the reader never saw the original URL:

````markdown
```dashboard:reload-dashboard
name: Application
url: {{< param ingress_protocol >}}://app-{{< param session_hostname >}}/admin
```
````

The reader may wonder: what was the Application tab showing before? Why is it now being pointed at `/admin`?

**Correct — dynamic creation makes the initial URL visible in context:**

The dashboard is not pre-defined in the workshop definition. Instead, it is created in the instructions the first time it is needed:

````markdown
Open the application in a new dashboard tab:

```dashboard:create-dashboard
name: Application
url: {{< param ingress_protocol >}}://app-{{< param session_hostname >}}/
```
````

Later, when the URL needs to change, the reader already knows what the tab was showing:

````markdown
Now switch the Application tab to the admin interface:

```dashboard:reload-dashboard
name: Application
url: {{< param ingress_protocol >}}://app-{{< param session_hostname >}}/admin
```
````

Note that pre-defining dashboards in `spec.session.dashboards` is still appropriate when the tab's URL will not change during the workshop — for example, when the tab simply displays a web application and the user interacts with it at the same URL throughout.
