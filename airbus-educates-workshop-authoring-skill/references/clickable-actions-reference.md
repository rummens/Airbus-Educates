# Clickable Actions Reference

This guide covers the use of clickable actions in workshop instruction pages. Clickable actions provide interactive elements that users can click to execute commands, copy text, edit files, and more.

For detailed syntax and examples of each action type, see the category-specific reference files linked below.

## How Clickable Actions Work

Clickable actions are implemented as fenced Markdown code blocks with special language types. The language type determines the action behavior, and the block body contains YAML configuration.

**Basic syntax:**

````markdown
```<action-type>
<yaml-body>
```
````

**Example:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: kubectl get pods
```
````

## YAML Syntax Safety for Clickable Actions

Because the body of every clickable action is parsed as YAML, you must ensure the content is valid YAML. Two common categories of mistakes cause broken workshop instructions: YAML-special characters in values, and invalid shell quoting in commands.

### YAML-special characters in command values

YAML treats certain characters as syntax when they appear in unquoted scalar values. The most common problem is a **colon followed by a space** (`: `), which YAML interprets as a mapping key-value separator. Other problematic characters include `#` (comment), `{` `}` (flow mapping), `[` `]` (flow sequence), `>` `|` (block scalars), `&` `*` (anchors/aliases), `!` (tags), `%` (directives), and backticks.

When a `command:` value or any other string property contains these characters, the YAML parser will either error or silently misparse the content. The fix is to use YAML block scalar syntax (`|-` for strip-trailing-newline, or `|` for keep-trailing-newline) instead of putting the value on the same line as the key.

**WRONG — colon in command breaks YAML parsing:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: docker run -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```
````

**CORRECT — block scalar avoids the problem:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  docker run -p 8080:80 nginx:latest
```
````

**WRONG — hash character starts a YAML comment:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: echo hello # this is not a yaml comment
```
````

**CORRECT:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  echo hello # this is a shell comment, safe inside block scalar
```
````

**Rule of thumb:** If a command contains any of `: # { } [ ] > | & * ! % @` or backticks, always use block scalar syntax (`command: |-`). When in doubt, use block scalar syntax — it is always safe and never hurts.

For multi-line commands (heredocs, pipelines, etc.), block scalar syntax is required:

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  cat << 'EOF' > config.yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Service
  metadata:
    name: my-service
  EOF
```
````

### Shell quoting in commands

Commands executed via `terminal:execute` run in a shell. The command string must be valid shell syntax. Common mistakes:

**WRONG — unquoted string with spaces:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  echo Hello World > /tmp/my file.txt
```
````

**CORRECT — proper shell quoting:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  echo "Hello World" > "/tmp/my file.txt"
```
````

**WRONG — unquoted variable that may contain spaces:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  cat $HOME/my documents/file.txt
```
````

**CORRECT:**

````markdown
```terminal:execute
command: |-
  cat "$HOME/my documents/file.txt"
```
````

Always test that commands work correctly in a terminal before embedding them in workshop instructions.

### Trailing blank lines in text properties

When a `text` or `replacement` property in an editor clickable action ends with one or more blank lines, those blank lines can be silently lost. This happens because Hugo's Markdown processor strips trailing blank lines from inside fenced code blocks before the content reaches the YAML parser. If the property with trailing blank lines is the last property in the YAML block, the blank lines appear as trailing content in the code fence and Hugo removes them.

The fix requires two things:

1. Use the YAML block scalar **keep chomping indicator** (`|+` instead of `|`) on the property value. Without `+`, YAML's default "clip" chomping strips trailing newlines from the value before the clickable action sees it.
2. Add a dummy property `eot: true` ("end of text") as the **last** property in the YAML block. This ensures the trailing blank lines in the `text` or `replacement` value are interior to the code fence rather than trailing, so Hugo preserves them.

Both are required — `|+` alone fails because Hugo still strips the trailing blank lines from the code fence, and `eot: true` alone fails because YAML's clip chomping removes them.

**WRONG — trailing blank line in `text` is silently stripped by Hugo:**

````markdown
```editor:insert-lines-before-selection
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: |
  # --- Section boundary ---

```
````

**CORRECT — `|+` preserves in YAML, `eot: true` preserves in Hugo:**

````markdown
```editor:insert-lines-before-selection
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: |+
  # --- Section boundary ---

eot: true
```
````

The `eot: true` property has no meaning to the clickable action itself — it exists solely to prevent Hugo from discarding trailing blank lines. The `+` modifier on the block scalar tells YAML to keep trailing newlines rather than stripping them. Use both together whenever a `text`, `replacement`, or other block scalar property needs to end with one or more blank lines. This applies to any editor clickable action with text content, including `editor:create-file`, `editor:append-lines-to-file`, `editor:prepend-lines-to-file`, `editor:replace-text-selection`, `editor:replace-matching-text`, `editor:insert-lines-before-selection`, `editor:append-lines-after-selection`, and others.

### Editor YAML Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/editor-yaml-actions.md](clickable-actions/editor-yaml-actions.md).

These provide structured YAML manipulation that preserves comments and handles all YAML styles. They replace the deprecated `editor:insert-value-into-yaml`.

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `editor:set-yaml-value` | Set or update a value at a YAML path |
| `editor:add-yaml-item` | Append an item to a YAML sequence |

### Editor Terminal Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/editor-terminal-actions.md](clickable-actions/editor-terminal-actions.md).

These manage terminals within the VS Code editor, separate from dashboard terminals. Editor terminals use named string sessions (e.g., `"educates"`, `"build"`) rather than the integer session numbers used by dashboard `terminal:*` actions.

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `editor:open-terminal` | Open or create a terminal in the editor |
| `editor:send-to-terminal` | Send text/command to an editor terminal |
| `editor:interrupt-terminal` | Send Ctrl+C to an editor terminal |
| `editor:clear-terminal` | Clear an editor terminal buffer |
| `editor:close-terminal` | Close and dispose of an editor terminal |
| `editor:execute-command` | Execute a registered VS Code command |

### Dashboard Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/dashboard-actions.md](clickable-actions/dashboard-actions.md).

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `dashboard:open-url` | Open a URL in a new browser tab |
| `dashboard:open-dashboard` | Show/focus a dashboard tab |
| `dashboard:create-dashboard` | Create a new dashboard tab (URL or terminal) |
| `dashboard:reload-dashboard` | Reload a dashboard tab (or create if missing) |
| `dashboard:delete-dashboard` | Delete a custom dashboard tab |

### Section Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/section-actions.md](clickable-actions/section-actions.md).

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `section:begin` | Start a collapsible section |
| `section:end` | End a collapsible section |
| `section:heading` | Non-collapsible styled heading |

### File Transfer Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/file-transfer-actions.md](clickable-actions/file-transfer-actions.md).

Require file download/upload to be enabled in the workshop configuration.

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `files:download-file` | Download a file to the user's local computer |
| `files:copy-file` | Copy file contents to the user's clipboard |
| `files:upload-file` | Upload a single file with a predetermined name |
| `files:upload-files` | Upload one or more files keeping original names |

### Examiner Actions

For details see [clickable-actions/examiner-actions.md](clickable-actions/examiner-actions.md).

Require the test examiner to be enabled in the workshop configuration.

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `examiner:execute-test` | Run a verification test script |

### Copy Actions

| Action Type | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `workshop:copy` | Copy text to the system clipboard |
| `workshop:copy-and-edit` | Copy text to clipboard, visually flagged as needing editing |

Both actions accept a single property:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `text` | string | (required) | The text to copy to the clipboard |

Use `workshop:copy` when the text can be pasted verbatim. Use `workshop:copy-and-edit` when the text contains a placeholder the learner must customize before pasting (e.g., a username or personal token). The `copy-and-edit` variant renders with a visual indicator reminding the learner to edit the value.

**Example — verbatim copy:**

````markdown
```workshop:copy
text: export MY_VAR=some-fixed-value
```
````

**Example — copy with editing required:**

````markdown
```workshop:copy-and-edit
text: export MY_TOKEN=replace-with-your-token
```
````

## Common Properties

These optional properties can be added to any clickable action that accepts YAML. Do not set `prefix`, `title`, or `description` unless you need to override the default display — the system generates sensible defaults.

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `prefix` | string | (auto) | Prefix for the banner (e.g., "Run", "Section") |
| `title` | string | (auto) | Title text in the banner |
| `description` | string | — | Additional text below the banner (always pre-formatted) |
| `autostart` | boolean | `false` | Trigger the action automatically on page load (or section expand) |
| `cascade` | boolean | `false` | Trigger the next clickable action when this one succeeds |
| `hidden` | boolean | `false` | Hide the action from view (useful with `autostart`) |
| `cooldown` | number | `3` | Seconds before action can be re-clicked. `.INF` or `-1` to prevent re-clicking |
| `event` | string/object | — | Analytics event name or object sent to the registry webhook |

## Deprecated Clickable Actions

Do NOT use these. Use the recommended alternatives:

| Deprecated Action | Use Instead |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `execute` | `terminal:execute` |
| `execute-1`, `execute-2`, `execute-3` | `terminal:execute` with `session` property |
| `execute-all` | `terminal:execute-all` |
| `copy` | `workshop:copy` |
| `copy-and-edit` | `workshop:copy-and-edit` |
| `editor:insert-lines-after-line` | `editor:append-lines-after-line` |
| `editor:insert-value-into-yaml` | `editor:set-yaml-value`, `editor:add-yaml-item`, `editor:insert-yaml-item`, `editor:replace-yaml-item`, `editor:delete-yaml-value`, `editor:merge-yaml-values` |
