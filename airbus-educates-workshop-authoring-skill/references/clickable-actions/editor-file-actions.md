# Editor File Clickable Actions

Actions for opening, creating, editing, and managing files through the embedded editor. These require the editor to be enabled in the workshop session.

Note: When a `text` or `replacement` property ends with trailing blank lines, those blank lines will be silently lost — YAML's default chomping strips trailing newlines, and Hugo strips trailing blank lines from code fences. To preserve them, use the `|+` keep chomping indicator on the block scalar and add `eot: true` as the final property. See the ["Trailing blank lines in text properties"](../clickable-actions-reference.md#trailing-blank-lines-in-text-properties) section in the clickable actions reference for details.

## editor:open-file

Opens a file in the editor. Optionally positions the cursor on a specific line.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path. Use `~/` or `$HOME/` for home directory |
| `line` | integer | — | Line number to position cursor on (1-indexed) |

Note: When the embedded editor is enabled in a workshop, prefer using this action to display file contents to users rather than using terminal commands like `cat`.

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:open-file
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
line: 8
```
````

## editor:create-file

Creates a new file with the specified content, or overwrites an existing file entirely. The containing directory must already exist.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Content for the file |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:create-file
file: ~/exercises/config.yaml
text: |
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: example
  data:
    key: value
```
````

## editor:create-directory

Creates a directory. Use this before `editor:create-file` or `editor:append-lines-to-file` if the target directory does not exist.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `directory` | string | (required) | Directory path to create |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:create-directory
directory: ~/exercises/configs
```
````

## editor:append-lines-to-file

Appends text to the end of a file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to append |

Note: If it is known the file does not already exist, use `editor:create-file` instead for clearer semantic intent.

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:append-lines-to-file
file: ~/exercises/notes.txt
text: |
  Additional notes added at the end.
```
````

## editor:prepend-lines-to-file

Prepends text to the beginning of a file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to prepend |

Note: If it is known the file does not already exist, use `editor:create-file` instead for clearer semantic intent.

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:prepend-lines-to-file
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: |
  # Copyright 2024 Example Corp.
  # Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0
```
````

## editor:insert-lines-before-line

Inserts text before a specified line number.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |

line: 5
text: |
  import logging
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```
````

## editor:append-lines-after-line

Inserts text after a specified line number.

Note: This action was previously named `editor:insert-lines-after-line`. The old name still works but is deprecated — use `editor:append-lines-after-line` in new content. The new name is consistent with the naming convention where "insert" means before and "append" means after.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `line` | integer | (required) | Line number to insert after (1-indexed) |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to insert |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:append-lines-after-line
file: ~/exercises/app.py
line: 3
text: |
  import os
```
````

## editor:append-lines-after-match

Inserts text after the first line containing a matching string.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `match` | string | (required) | Text to search for in lines |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to insert after the matching line |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:append-lines-after-match
file: ~/exercises/requirements.txt
match: flask
text: |
  flask-cors==4.0.0
```
````

## editor:insert-lines-before-match

Inserts text before the first line containing a matching string.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `match` | string | (required) | Text to search for in lines |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to insert before the matching line |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:insert-lines-before-match
file: ~/exercises/requirements.txt
match: flask
text: |
  # Web framework dependencies
```
````

## editor:select-matching-text

Selects (highlights) text in a file based on exact match or regular expression. Useful as a visual aid or as a precursor to `editor:replace-text-selection`, `editor:insert-lines-before-selection`, `editor:append-lines-after-selection`, or `editor:delete-text-selection`.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text or regex pattern to match |
| `isRegex` | boolean | `false` | Treat `text` as a regular expression |
| `group` | integer | — | Regex subgroup to select (when using regex) |
| `before` | integer | — | Extra lines to highlight before match. `0` = full line, `-1` = all lines before |
| `after` | integer | — | Extra lines to highlight after match. `0` = full line, `-1` = all lines after |
| `start` | integer | — | Start line for search range (1-indexed). Negative = offset from end |
| `stop` | integer | — | End line for search range (exclusive). Negative = offset from end |

**Example — exact match:**

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: "image: nginx:1.19"
```
````

**Example — regex with subgroup:**

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: "image: (.*)"
isRegex: true
group: 1
```
````

### Multi-line matching

The `text` property can span multiple lines, allowing you to select an entire block of content in the editor.

**Example — select a multi-line block:**

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: |
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
```
````

When the text to match starts with leading spaces (because it is indented within the file), use the YAML block scalar **indent indicator** to preserve those spaces. The digit after `|` specifies how many spaces form the indentation level:

**Example — select indented content using indent indicator:**

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: |2
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v1
```
````

Without the indent indicator (`|2`), the YAML parser strips the leading spaces and the match fails against the indented content in the file. See the [indent indicator note under `editor:replace-matching-text`](#multi-line-matching-and-replacement) for a fuller explanation.

## editor:select-lines-in-range

Selects a range of lines by line number. The selected text can then be acted on using `editor:replace-text-selection`, `editor:insert-lines-before-selection`, `editor:append-lines-after-selection`, or `editor:delete-text-selection`.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `start` | integer | (required) | First line to select (1-indexed, inclusive) |
| `stop` | integer | — | Last line to select (inclusive). If omitted, only `start` line is selected |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:select-lines-in-range
file: ~/exercises/app.py
start: 5
stop: 10
```
````

## editor:replace-text-selection

Replaces the currently selected text in a file (selected via `editor:select-matching-text` or `editor:select-lines-in-range`).

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Replacement text |

**Example:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-text-selection
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: nginx:latest
```
````

## editor:insert-lines-before-selection

Inserts text before the currently selected text in a file. This is a two-step action — text must first be selected using `editor:select-matching-text` or `editor:select-lines-in-range`.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to insert before the selection |

**Example:**

First, select the target text:

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: "def main():"
after: 0
```
````

Then insert a comment block before it:

````markdown
```editor:insert-lines-before-selection
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: |
  # Entry point for the application
```
````

## editor:append-lines-after-selection

Appends text after the currently selected text in a file. This is a two-step action — text must first be selected using `editor:select-matching-text` or `editor:select-lines-in-range`.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `text` | string | (required) | Text to append after the selection |

**Example:**

First, select the target text:

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: "import flask"
after: 0
```
````

Then append additional imports after it:

````markdown
```editor:append-lines-after-selection
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: |
  import logging
  import os
```
````

## editor:delete-text-selection

Deletes the currently selected text in a file. This is a two-step action — text must first be selected using `editor:select-matching-text` or `editor:select-lines-in-range`. If there is no current selection, the action is a no-op.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |

**Example:**

First, select the text to delete:

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/app.py
text: "# TODO: remove this temporary workaround"
after: 0
```
````

Then delete the selected text:

````markdown
```editor:delete-text-selection
file: ~/exercises/app.py
```
````

### Two-step workflow for replacements involving multi-line text

When either the text being matched or its replacement spans multiple lines, use `editor:select-matching-text` to highlight the target block first, then `editor:replace-text-selection` to apply the replacement. Place explanatory commentary between the two actions so the learner has time to read the highlighted code and understand what is about to change. This is preferred over a single `editor:replace-matching-text` because the instant replacement otherwise makes it difficult for the learner to see what was there before.

**Example — select, explain, then replace a multi-line block:**

First, highlight the block that will be replaced:

````markdown
```editor:select-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: |
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
```
````

The current resource requests are quite conservative. We are going to replace them with higher requests and also add resource limits. This ensures the container gets enough resources to run reliably while preventing it from consuming more than its fair share on the cluster.

````markdown
```editor:replace-text-selection
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
text: |
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 256Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
```
````

## editor:replace-matching-text

Find and replace text in a single step, without needing to first select and then replace separately. Best suited for **single-line-to-single-line replacements** where both the matched text and its replacement are a single line, making the change easy for the learner to follow.

When **either the text being matched or its replacement spans multiple lines**, prefer the two-step workflow of `editor:select-matching-text` followed by `editor:replace-text-selection`. When a replacement involves multi-line text on either side, the change happens instantly and the learner has no opportunity to see what was there before. The two-step approach highlights the target block first, giving the learner time to read the existing code, and then a separate action applies the replacement. Place explanatory commentary between the two actions so the learner understands what is about to change and why. When the replacement would cover an entire file's contents — for example, swapping one code example for the next in a teaching sequence — consider providing the new version as a separate pre-created file instead, so the learner retains visibility of the original for comparison.

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `file` | string | (required) | File path |
| `match` | string | (required) | Text or regex to find |
| `replacement` | string | (required) | Replacement text |
| `isRegex` | boolean | `false` | Treat `match` as regex |
| `group` | integer | — | Regex subgroup to replace |
| `start` | integer | — | Start line for search range |
| `stop` | integer | — | End line for search range (exclusive) |
| `count` | integer | `1` | Number of matches to replace. `-1` = all matches |

**Example — simple replacement:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: "nginx:1.19"
replacement: "nginx:1.25"
```
````

**Example — regex replace all occurrences:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: "replicas: [0-9]+"
replacement: "replicas: 3"
isRegex: true
count: -1
```
````

### Multi-line matching and replacement

The `match` and `replacement` properties can span multiple lines, allowing you to find and replace entire blocks of content such as YAML fragments, code blocks, or configuration sections.

**Example — replace a multi-line YAML block:**

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: |
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 100m
      memory: 128Mi
replacement: |
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: 250m
      memory: 256Mi
    limits:
      cpu: 500m
      memory: 512Mi
```
````

**YAML indentation indicator for preserving leading spaces:** When the replacement text has leading spaces on the first line (common with indented code or YAML fragments), use the YAML block scalar **indent indicator** — a digit after the `|` that specifies how many spaces form the indentation. Without it, YAML may strip or misinterpret the leading whitespace.

**Example — replacing indented content using indent indicator:**

If the content to match is nested inside a YAML structure and starts with spaces, use `|2` (or the appropriate indent level) to tell the YAML parser that the content is indented by that many spaces:

````markdown
```editor:replace-matching-text
file: ~/exercises/deployment.yaml
match: |2
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v1
replacement: |2
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myapp:v2
        env:
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: debug
```
````

The digit after `|` (e.g., `|2`, `|4`, `|6`) indicates the number of spaces used for indentation in the block content. The YAML parser uses this to correctly determine where the content starts, preserving all leading spaces as part of the actual text. Without the indicator, the YAML parser treats the leading spaces as YAML indentation and strips them, causing the match to fail or the replacement to be inserted with incorrect indentation.

## editor:replace-lines-in-range
