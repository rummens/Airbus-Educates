# Course Topics Reference

The topics document (`planning/course-topics.md`) is an inventory of topics the course could cover. It bridges the high-level course vision and the concrete workshop breakdowns.

## Purpose

The topics document serves as a brainstorming artefact and reference list. Its depth depends on the course scope:

- **Comprehensive courses**: The document aims to capture everything that *could* be covered, not just what *will* be covered. Topics are organized by module.
- **Standard courses**: The document covers the planned topics plus notes on potential expansion. Topics are organized by module (if multiple modules exist) or as a flat list.
- **Focused courses**: The document is optional. If the user already knows what their 1–3 workshops will cover, they can skip directly to the workshop breakdown. If created, it is a simple list of topics per workshop plus future expansion ideas.

The topics document is:

- **Organized by module** *(for courses with multiple modules)* or **as a flat list** *(for courses with a single module)* — topics are grouped logically.
- **Annotated** — notes identify topics that need special handling (conceptual topics, elective clusters, future expansion ideas, etc.).
- **Not a 1:1 mapping to workshops** — multiple topics may be combined into a single workshop, or a single large topic may span multiple workshops. That mapping happens in the workshop breakdown files.

## Structure

### Title

Use a descriptive title that identifies the course:

```markdown
# Workshop Ideas: [Course Subject]
```

### Topics by Module

For courses with multiple modules, each module gets a level-2 heading with a letter identifier, and each topic gets a level-3 heading with a number that restarts at 1 for each module:

```markdown
## Module A — [Module Title]

### 1. [Topic Title]
- Key concept or subtopic
- Another aspect to cover
- Practical application or example

### 2. [Topic Title]
- ...

## Module B — [Module Title]

### 1. [Topic Title]
- ...

### 2. [Topic Title]
- ...
```

Topic numbers restart at 1 for each module. Reference topics using both the module letter and topic number (e.g., "Topic A2" for the second topic in Module A). This prevents renumbering cascades when topics are added to an earlier module.

For courses with a single module, the module heading is optional. Topics can be listed as a flat numbered list:

```markdown
# Workshop Ideas: [Course Subject]

### 1. [Topic Title]
- Key concept or subtopic
- ...

### 2. [Topic Title]
- ...
```

Each topic includes bullet points describing what it covers in enough detail to assess:
- Whether the topic has enough substance for a workshop (or part of one)
- What the hands-on component would involve
- How it relates to other topics

### Notes on Topic Selection

After all topics, include a section with annotations that guide the mapping from topics to workshops:

```markdown
## Notes on Topic Selection
```

Common annotations include:

**Topics that are primarily conceptual**: Identify topics that may not have enough hands-on code content to sustain a standalone workshop. Note which neighbouring topics they could be folded into.

**Elective clusters** *(for courses using the core/elective model)*: Identify groups of topics that follow a similar code pattern (e.g., "build a decorator that does X") where the scaffolding is repetitive but the internal logic differs. These work well as elective workshops that learners pick from based on interest.

**Prerequisite observations**: Note obvious prerequisite chains that should inform workshop ordering (and core/elective classification, if the course uses that model).

**Future expansion ideas** *(especially valuable for focused and standard courses)*: Topics the user is not planning to cover now but might want to add later. These capture growth directions without committing to them, supporting incremental course development.

## Brainstorming Process

When working with the user to generate topics:

1. **Start from the course brief** — use the vision, scope, and module structure (if any) as the framework.
2. **Match depth to scope** — for comprehensive courses, aim for completeness: it is better to list more topics and prune later than to miss important ones. For standard courses, cover the planned topics and note expansion ideas without trying to enumerate everything. For focused courses, a simple list of what each workshop covers is sufficient.
3. **Think about progression** — within each module, order topics roughly from foundational to advanced. This ordering is not binding but helps identify natural prerequisite chains.
4. **Consider the hands-on angle** — for each topic, think about what the learner would *do* in a workshop. If a topic is primarily "learn about X" with no clear code activity, flag it in the notes.
5. **Identify patterns** — for courses with enough workshops, look for clusters of topics that share a similar structure. These are candidates for elective workshops in courses using the core/elective model.
6. **Collaborate iteratively** — propose topics, get feedback, refine. The user knows the subject matter; the AI brings structure and completeness checking.

## Maintaining the Topics Document

The topics document is a living reference during the planning phase. As workshops are planned and implemented:

- Topics may be refined or clarified based on what is learned during detailed planning.
- New topics may be added if gaps are discovered.
- Topics may be annotated as "covered by Workshop A01" for traceability, though this is not required.

The document should not be significantly restructured once workshop planning has begun, as other documents reference topics by module letter and number.
